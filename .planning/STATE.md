## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 uses CSS `columns` masonry (not JS library) — prevents hydration mismatch and CLS failures
- [Roadmap]: LazyMotion + domAnimation configured in Phase 1 scaffolding — not retrofittable cheaply
- [Roadmap]: JSON-LD deployment gated on confirmed NAP from owner — do not deploy structured data with placeholder business details
- [Roadmap]: Quote form v1 is frontend-only success state — email routing (Resend) is v2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 5]: JSON-LD structured data requires confirmed business name, address, phone, and service hours from the site owner before Phase 5 can fully complete
- [Pre-Phase 4]: Before/after slider feature (PORT-03 / INTR-02) is gated on a matched before/after image pair from a real project — component ships in Phase 3 but may not surface in Phase 4 if no image pair is available
- [Pre-Launch]: Form submissions in v1 show a success state only — a capture mechanism (interim webhook or Resend) must be decided before production goes live
